if you are using agent/node, you have to mention the path mentioned in node. for example i gave "/opt/l3" in my agent, also after workspace and before target
you have to mention your item name... so the path would be like below

sh "sudo cp /opt/l3/workspace/l3asg/target/addressbook.war /home/ubuntu/tomcat9/webapps"

visudo to be done in agent
if any one changed the name of tomcat, then instead of apache tomcat mention the name u changed to (eg:tomcat9)

replace your github url.
